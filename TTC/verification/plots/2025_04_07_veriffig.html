But it seems like trees might be worth a try, So I say, let it grow. My name is Dan – and my name's Rose. Our son Wesley kinda glows And that's not good, so we suppose We should let it grow. Let it grow, let it grow, You can't reap what you don't sow! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way to know its worth. Let's celebrate the world's rebirth, We say let it grow. My name's Marie, And I am three! I would really like to see a tree, La la la la la lala lee, I say let it grow. I'm Grammy Norma, I'm old and I've got gray hair, But I remember when trees were everywhere, And no one had to pay for air! So I say let it grow! Let it grow, let it grow, Like it did so long ago. It is just one tiny seed, But it's all we really need, It's time to change the life we lead, Time to let it grow. My name's O'Hare, I'm one of you. I live here in Thneedville, too. The things you say just might be true. It could be time to start anew And maybe change my point of view! Nah! I say let it die! Let it die, let it die, Let it shrivel up and – Come on, who's with me? Nobody. You greedy dirtbag! Let it grow, let it grow, Let the love inside you show! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way to know its worth! Let's celebrate the world's rebirth, We say let it grow! Let it grow, let it grow You can't reap what you don't sow It's just one tiny seed But it's all we really need It's time to banish all your greed Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed Let this be our

It is just one tiny seed, But it's all we really need, It's time to change the life we lead, Time to let it grow. My name's O'Hare, I'm one of you. I live here in Thneedville, too. The things you say just might be true. It could be time to start anew And maybe change my point of view! Nah! I say let it die! Let it die, let it die, Let it shrivel up and – Come on, who's with me? Nobody. You greedy dirtbag! Let it grow, let it grow, Let the love inside you show! Plant the seed inside the earth, Just one way to know its worth! Let's celebrate the world's rebirth, We say let it grow! Let it grow, let it grow You can't reap what you don't sow It's just one tiny seed But it's all we really need It's time to banish all your greed Imagine Thneedville flowered and treed Let this be our

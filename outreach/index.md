The Iowa State Chapter of the American Meteorological Society strives to spread knowledge, increase awareness, and inspire interest about weather to people of all ages! From visiting preschools and high schools to teaming up with the National Weather Service for Storm Spotter trainings, we have events and activities for everyone. For more information about any of our events please visit our other pages!

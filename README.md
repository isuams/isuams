ISU AMS Website (powered by Jekyll) 
===================================

This repo handles the new [ISU AMS](https://www.meteor.iastate.edu/ams/) website. Auto-built on every update to master branch, which is then pulled by the department's web server every 15 minutes. If there are issues, it helps to check if the `github-pages` branch matches what is on the department's web server. If not, then focus your troubleshooting on the web server. If instead there is a problem with the site build (a red x by the commit), then focus your troubleshooting here on GitHub. If all else fails, contact Jon.

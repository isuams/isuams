Throughout the year, members of the chapter participate in severe weather awareness events across the community. The chapter has assisted members of the community program their weather radios when they purchase them at local stores. In the fall, members participate in Winter Weatherization to help keep homes in Story county warm in the winter. Beginning in 2016, the chapter organized a winter coat drive in collaboration with ACCESS of Story County to help those in need stay warm during the brutal winter months. In the spring, ISU AMS participates in Spring Fury, a community event bringing together students, broadcasters, and emergency management to help emphasize preparedness and action during severe weather. With help from the National Weather Service in Des Moines, a Storm Spotter training session is held where members of the community can learn how to spot severe weather threats.

Every year, the ISU AMS chapter sends a group of 20-25 students to the AMS Annual Meeting and Student Conference. The Annual Meeting serves as the largest gathering of scientists from 
the weather, water, and climate community in the world! Students have the opportunity to invest in their professional careers by participating in a variety of activities: presenting original research, networking with future employers and internship programs, developing communication and broadcast skills, and learning about scientific advances in the field from hundreds of research presentations.  

We are partnering with the ISU Foundation to help raise financial support for our students to attend the 106th AMS Annual Meeting and 25th Student Conference in Houston in January 2026. A web platform has been created which further describes the importance of the trip for our students. Current students have also written about their personal experiences at the Annual Meeting. If you would like to make a donation for our trip expenses (hotel, airfare, registration), please visit the website below. All contributions are very appreciated.

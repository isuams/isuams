Pam Daale Scholarship,http://www.iowa-nwa.com/conference/scholarship.php,Central Iowa NWA,"$1,500",Sophomore and Junior Meteorology Students with GPA at least 2.75,TBD Spring 2019,"""Pam Daale was best known as a television meteorologist at KMGH in Denver, but had numerous ties to Iowa. She was born and raised in Iowa, graduated from Iowa State University, and first worked at WOI-TV (Now ABC5 in Des Moines). Pam was an extremely popular meteorologist who courageously overcame adversity to not only succeed in her career but to help others. A horseback-riding accident at age 16 left her paraplegic, but this did not stop her from becoming a popular broadcast meteorologist. Later, as she fought cancer for nearly two years before her death in April 2004, she used her experiences to educate her viewers about the disease. In every aspect of her life, she had a tremendously positive impact on those around her. Her courage, strength, and concern for others, springing from a deep faith in God, should inspire us all."""
Tim Samaras Scholarship,http://www.iowa-nwa.com/conference/samaras_scholarship.php,Central Iowa NWA,"$1,500",Sophomore and Junior Meteorology Students with GPA at least 2.75,TBD Spring 2019,"""Tim Samaras was a world-famous engineer, inventor, and tornado researcher who had very close ties to our NWA Chapter. His presentations were always a highlight of the annual Severe Storm and Doppler Radar conferences since he first volunteered to speak in 2003. After that time, he was frequently an invited speaker at the conferences, often revealing to our audiences jaw-dropping video of tornadoes and lightning that was being seen by the general public for the first time. Of even greater impact to our chapter and the conference attendees than his ground-breaking scientific discoveries was his kind, approachable, and encouraging spirit. Numerous stories have been told of young students attending the conference being stunned that Tim treated them as equals, willing to answer their questions. Tim had a passion to create the next generation of scientists, which was evident in his use of student teams as a part of the TWISTEX project during the period 2006-2011. Because of his passion for both the atmosphere and for students, we can think of no better way to honor his memory than to create these awards which encourage students to pursue research and communicate it to the community.

<h2>What is the Earth Wind & Fire Learning Community?</h2>
<p>The Earth, Wind, and Fire learning community fosters stronger connections among students and faculty in the Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences. Its primary aim is to enhance student retention and recruitment by facilitating interactions with faculty, upperclassmen (through peer mentors), study sessions, and supplemental instruction.</p>

<h2>Who Can Join?</h2>
<p>Students who have declared their major as Meteorology, Geology, Climate Science, or Earth Science can join the learning community.</p>

<h2>How Do I Join?</h2>
<p>Any student who has declared their major as Meteorology, Geology, Climate Science, or Earth Science will automatically be signed up for the learning community during summer orientation.</p>

<h2>What Classes Are Offered?</h2>
<p>There are 2 classes offered in the Earth Wind & Fire Learning Community. The first class is MTEOR/GEOL 1120, which is only offered in the fall and is the class students are automatically enrolled in during summer orientation. MTEOR/GEOL 1120 serves as an introduction to Iowa State University and helps freshmen/transfer students adjust to living and studying at Iowa State University. Activities during the semester include academic-related activities (math tutoring, SI sessions, office hours), social activities in conjunction with the AMS Student Chapter at ISU and Geology Club, and academic seminars through the Department of Geological and Atmospheric Sciences.</p>
<p>The second class is MTEOR 1130, which is only offered in the spring. Students are encouraged to take this after completing MTEOR/GEOL 1120, but it is not required. MTEOR/GEOL 1130 focuses on professionalism in an academic and business setting, as well as being professional on social media. The class also focuses on the importance of High Impact Practices (HIP) helps students think about career choices and prepare them for applying for jobs through interview strategies and how to write cover letters.

One goal that ISU AMS endlessly strives for is educating the next generation of meteorologists. Throughout the year, members give students of all ages presentations on weather, weather safety, and careers in meteorology. At elementary school science nights, members have the pleasure of experiencing weather first hands with children by making cloud pictures, trying tornadoes in a bottle, building anemometers,  and answering weather trivia. With the help of videos, crafts, and the tornado simulator, we hope to instill a lifelong love of science and exploration to all.
